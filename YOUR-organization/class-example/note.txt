Introduction to CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
It is used for styling the web page

3 ways to add CSS to HTML
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

Inline CSS
The CSS is added directly to a line of html element using an attribute(style).
The basic syntax of CSS is the property-value pair
{property}: {value};
  color   :  green;

If the property name contains 2 words, they are seperated with an hyphen  

Internal CSS
Here, the css is added in one place in the html. It is always the last thing in the head section of the html structure. It is added using the style element.

IN internal CSS, you identify elements on the html page as "selectors" and style them individually or together

selector {
    All CSS styling to be applied to specified selector
}

External CSS
The CSS is a seperate file and it is linked to the html using the link tag.


Order of priority in CSS styling
IF you style the same element with inline CSS, internal CSS and External CSS, the inline would always take the highest priority over the other 2

Colors in CSS
The 3 ways to add colors are:
1. Color name
color: green;

2. RGB value of color
color: rgb(12, 45, 67);

min is 0, max is 255
